            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
                The founder of our company and current CEO, Caleb Carlile, once had a spark of brilliance: What if we create a giant version of a tablet and use it as a table? He gathered some of his engineers to develop this idea, and thus, the Table-let was born. The prototype was released in early-2017 and has since sold over 500,000 units nationwide. The company is now developing software tailor-made for the Table-let, such as digital board and tabletop games, multiplayer party games, and even a custom-made version of Microsoft Office!
